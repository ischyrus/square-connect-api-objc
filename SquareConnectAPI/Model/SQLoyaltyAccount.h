If this field is not set in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request, Square populates it after the buyer's first action on their account  (when `AccumulateLoyaltyPoints` or `CreateLoyaltyReward` is called). In first-party flows, Square populates the field when the buyer agrees to the terms of service in Square Point of Sale.   This field is typically specified in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request when creating a loyalty account for a buyer who already interacted with their account.  For example, you would set this field when migrating accounts from an external system. The timestamp in the request can represent a current or previous date and time, but it cannot be set for the future. [optional]
