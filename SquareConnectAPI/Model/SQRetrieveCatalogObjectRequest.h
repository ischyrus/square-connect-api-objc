/* If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user. This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,  if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation, its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response.  Default value: `false` [optional]

The value to retrieve a specific version of an object can be found in the version field of [CatalogObject](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2023-10-18/objects/CatalogObject)s. If not included, results will be from the current version of the catalog. [optional]
