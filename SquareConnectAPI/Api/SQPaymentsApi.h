/// CancelPayment
/// Cancels (voids) a payment. You can use this endpoint to cancel a payment with  the APPROVED `status`.
///
/// @param paymentId The ID of the payment to cancel.

/// CancelPaymentByIdempotencyKey
/// Cancels (voids) a payment identified by the idempotency key that is specified in the request.  Use this method when the status of a `CreatePayment` request is unknown (for example, after you send a `CreatePayment` request, a network error occurs and you do not get a response). In this case, you can direct Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same idempotency key that you provided in your `CreatePayment` request that you want to cancel. After canceling the payment, you can submit your `CreatePayment` request again.  Note that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken and the endpoint returns successfully.

/// @param cursor A pagination cursor returned by a previous call to this endpoint. Provide this cursor to retrieve the next set of results for the original query.  For more information, see [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/pagination). (optional)
/// @param locationId Limit results to the location supplied. By default, results are returned for the default (main) location associated with the seller. (optional)
