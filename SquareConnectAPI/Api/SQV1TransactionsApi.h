/// V1CreateRefund
/// Issues a refund for a previously processed payment. You must issue a refund within 60 days of the associated payment.  You cannot issue a partial refund for a split tender payment. You must instead issue a full or partial refund for a particular tender, by providing the applicable tender id to the V1CreateRefund endpoint. Issuing a full refund for a split tender payment refunds all tenders associated with the payment.  Issuing a refund for a card payment is not reversible. For development purposes, you can create fake cash payments in Square Point of Sale and refund them.

/// Provides summary information for all payments taken for a given Square account during a date range. Date ranges cannot exceed 1 year in length. See Date ranges for details of inclusive and exclusive dates.  *Note**: Details for payments processed with Square Point of Sale while in offline mode may not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline payments have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the payment was originally processed, not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square. Consequently, the ListPayments endpoint might list an offline payment chronologically between online payments that were seen in a previous request.

Most settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual adjustments, or chargeback holds.  Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807) help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.  Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may take longer.
