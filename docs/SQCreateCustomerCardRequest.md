**cardNonce** | **NSString*** | A card nonce representing the credit card to link to the customer.  Card nonces are generated by the Square payment form when customers enter their card information. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Integrate Square Payments in a Website](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/take-card-payment).  __NOTE:__ Card nonces generated by digital wallets (such as Apple Pay) cannot be used to create a customer card. | 
**billingAddress** | [**SQAddress***](SQAddress.md) | Address information for the card on file.  __NOTE:__ If a billing address is provided in the request, the &#x60;CreateCustomerCardRequest.billing_address.postal_code&#x60; must match the postal code encoded in the card nonce. | [optional] 
**cardholderName** | **NSString*** | The full name printed on the credit card. | [optional] 
**verificationToken** | **NSString*** | An identifying token generated by [Payments.verifyBuyer()](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/Payments#Payments.verifyBuyer). Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity. | [optional]
